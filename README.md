# ITI Marconi App 
High school project for the school ITI G.Marconi (Verona).</br>
Application made with Flutter that **contains most relevant school services in one place**.

## Purpose
The school's services (such as class schedule, grades list, agenda, ...) are only accessible from different and incompatible platforms.</br>
So we have decided to create an app that allows access to school data in an easy, **fast** and **intuitive** way.

## Development
### Ambiente di sviluppo
We chose to use **Flutter** for various reasons.
- the possibility to create **multiplatform apps** with only one code. This has allowed us to build the app in less time and using fewer resources.
- the desire to **learn** how to use this framework, given the appreciation it is experiencing.
### App structure
The app has been developed following the **DDD** (*Domain-Driven-Development*) model, which has allowed the app to be more flexible and maintainable.</br>
The separation into various layers allows the addition of a **new function** with relative ease, without having to modify codes already made.
